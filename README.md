React Image Gallery
Description
Duration: 2 Week Sprint

Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

The result of this project is an image gallery that utilizes React on the front end, and Express server, and a postgresql database on the back end. Users can add photos to the image gallery by putting a link and description in the input fields at the top of the page. Users can also "like" images, delete images, and toggle back and forth between the image and the description by clicking the image or description div. The side is styled with a combination of CSS and Material UI.
